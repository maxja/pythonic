Python learning playground [→ru](README.ru.md)
===

This repository will document my learning journey with the Python language and its supporting tools.

> **Disclaimer**: I have some prior experience with Python, particularly with Python 2.

## Commitment

I will be following various books and will provide code samples and notes based on what I have learned and understood.
All references to books will be accompanied by links leading to a reference list.

## Books references

1. [Think Python, 2nd ed by Allen B. Downey][1]

## Setup

Python 3 (hereinafter Python) — the target version of the language that interests me in the learning process.

Python can be installed as a standalone package, and there are many ways to do this, varying from one operating system
to another.

Allen Downey, the author of the book ["Python Basics"][1], suggests using the online service [Python Anywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/), although there are many other platforms available, such as [Google Colab](https://colab.google/).

## About Language

Python is an interpreted language.
