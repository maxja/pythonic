Python learning playground [â†’ru](README.ru.md)
===

This repository will document my learning journey with the Python language and its supporting tools.

> **Disclaimer**: I have some prior experience with Python, particularly with Python 2.

## Commitment

I will be following various books and will provide code samples and notes based on what I have learned and understood.
All references to books will be accompanied by links leading to a reference list.
